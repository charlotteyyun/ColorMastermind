# ColorMastermind
Simple text based guessing game. This game is traditional a two-player code breaking game. One player (i.e., the codemaker) creates a secret code of four colored pegs. The 4 character secret code can be made up of any combination of six options: Red, Green, Yellow, Purple, Black, or Orange and can include multiples of any color (e.g., OOOB (Orange, Orange, Orange, and Black)). The player attempts to guess the pattern (both in color and order) within 10 “turns”/guesses.  The program will interact with the user by asking the user to enter a guess. The program will provide feedback on the guess: correct Peg in the correct location will be replicated in the feedback in the same location; correct Peg in wrong location will be indicated as a "W" in the feedback; wrong Peg will be indicated as a "_" in the feedback. When the player answers correctly, their score will be displayed and the game will resume with a different answer. The answers are stored in input.txt.
